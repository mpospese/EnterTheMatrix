You are free to share it and to remix it remix under the following conditions:

* You must attribute the work in the manner specified by the author (SEE BELOW).
* For any reuse or distribution, you must make clear to others the license terms of this work.
* The above conditions can be waived if you get permission from the copyright holder (send me an email!).

THIS MEANS -- You're free to use these icons for commercial and non-commercial purposes, for yourself, your company and your clients, and to edit, remix and otherwise modify them without attribution. You man not sell or redistribute the icons themselves as icons. Additionally, you may not use them in a way that encourages downstream distribution -- this means no templates or skins or theme kits or similar uses. (The person using the theme or template might not know where the icons came from and thus wouldn't be following the license.)

ATTRIBUTION -- A note on your app's website, like "Icons by Glyphish" or similar, plus a link back to glyphish.com, is the preferred form of attribution. For questions about attribution, contact me via the Glyphish website.

USE WITHOUT ATTRIBUTION -- If attribution is not possible, workable or desirable for your application, get in touch to discuss other options.
